<h3>Hi im going to show you how to set a Alphanumeric Code on your Apple Device</h3>
<br>
<h4><strong>Step 1: </strong>You First you go into your settings then open up Passcode and then put in your code if you have one, if you dont then it doesnt matter</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 2: </strong>Then you hit change passcode or in your case you can click turn on passcode</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 3: </strong>And then you will see you have to enter in a number one but im not showing you that the one im showing you is a letter one, so you hit passcode options and there is other options, but you hit custom Alphanumeric Code</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 4: </strong>Then you can custom a code and no one will be able to look in and look a all your private and confidental stuff</h4>
