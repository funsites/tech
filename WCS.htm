<h4><strong>Step 2: </strong>Once Disk Cleanup finds unnecessary files, allow it to delete them.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 3: </strong>Get a USB flash drive and put some files on it.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 4: </strong>Now that some files have been saved onto the USB flash drive, you can delete them from the actual computer.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 5: </strong>Empty the Recycle Bin on the computer.</h4>
