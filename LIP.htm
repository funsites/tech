<h3>Hi im going to show you how to link your iphone with other apple devices of yours</h3>
<br>
<h4><strong>Step 1: </strong>First you will need to open up your iphone and go into "settings"</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 2: </strong> then go down and you will see "Messages" then you go into it and under the button that says "iMessage" there will be a option that says "Text Message Forwarding" and if you have other devices this is going to work but if you dont have any other apple products apart from your iphone, then this tutorial is not going to work for you sorry, but anyways, so you click on "Text Message Forwarding" and then other devices with the same apple ID as your iphone will pop up and there will be a button beside each one, so you turn on the ones you want on and then you have to log on that device before you turn it on, and then a code will appear up on the device that you turned on to Forward your iphone calls and texts and then you will type up the code that appears on the devices home screen into your IPhone</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 3: </strong>So that is how to Forward your texts and calls from your IPhone to whatever device you have</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 4: </strong>Enjoy!
